=head1 NAME

pc-benchmark - Measure performance of Perl::Refactor


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  pc-benchmark FILE
  PERL5LIB=foo/bar/lib pc-benchmark FILE
  perl -Ifoo/bar/lib pc-benchmark FILE


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple program that uses the L<Benchmark> module to measure
the general speed of L<Perl::Refactor>.  For the specified F<FILE>, the
C<Perl::Refactor::refactor()> function is called 100 times, with all the
'core' Policies enabled with their default configuration.  The total
elapsed/system/user/ time is displayed.

To compare the performance of two versions of L<Perl::Refactor>, you'll
need to run this command twice, and alter the C<@INC> so that it loads
the right version of the libraries you want to use.  For example:

  PERL5LIB=/path/to/slow/version/lib pc-benchmark FILE
  PERL5LIB=/path/to/fast/version/lib pc-benchmark FILE

For an apples-to-apples comparison, be sure to use the same F<FILE>
for both runs.


=head1 CAVEATS

This is the first time I've used L<Benchmark>, so I don't know if this
program is "correct" or even useful.  It just seemed like an interesting
thing to do.
